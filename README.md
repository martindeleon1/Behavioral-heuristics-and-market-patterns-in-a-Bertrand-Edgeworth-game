# Behavioral-heuristics-and-market-patterns-in-a-Bertrand-Edgeworth-game

This is the final project for the university course Computational and Dynamic Models in Economics. We used R to create and analyze the dynamic model presented in the paper Behavioral heuristics and market patterns in a Bertrand â€“ Edgeworth game by D. Heymann, E. Kawamura, R. Perazzo, M.G. Zimmermann. We also used simulation to understand how different values of the parameters may change the outcome. 

The code used in the presentation, as well as the final one submitted for evaluation and the presentation can be found here.
