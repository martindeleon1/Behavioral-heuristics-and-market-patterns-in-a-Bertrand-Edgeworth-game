# Behavioral-heuristics-and-market-patterns-in-a-Bertrand-Edgeworth-game

This is the final project for the university course Computational and Dynamic Models in Economics. We used R to create and analyze the dynamic model presented in the paper Behavioral heuristics and market patterns in a Bertrand â€“ Edgeworth game by D. Heymann, E. Kawamura, R. Perazzo, M.G. Zimmermann. We also used simulation to understand how different values of the parameters may change the outcome.
